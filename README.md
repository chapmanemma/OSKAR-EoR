# OSKAR-EoR
Scripts for running OSKAR on EoR data with LOFAR and SKA telescope models.
The OSKAR documentation can be found here: http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/~ska/oskar2/


## Telescope Models  
Coordinates and layouts all use the latest SKA1-LOW Configuration Coordinates (https://astronomers.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422_02_SKA1_LowConfigurationCoordinates-1.pdf) as a basis for Revision 2 coordinates. Revision 3 coordinates came from private correspondance and will be likely published shortly.

- SKA_core_area*.tm (stations within a core diameter of 1000m)
- SKA_central_area*.tm (stations within a central diameter of 3400m)
- SKA_all_stations*.tm (all stations in the full 65km SKA layout)
